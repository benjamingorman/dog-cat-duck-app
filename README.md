# dog-cat-duck-app

This is a demo webapp to display dog, cat & duck images using an Angular frontend and a NestJS backend.

The only requirement is a recent version of Node (with npm).

First, run the backend (on port 3000):

```bash
$ cd dog-cat-duck-backend
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

Then, in another shell, run the frontend (on port 4200):

```bash
$ cd dog-cat-duck-app
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

The app should now be live and accessible at http://localhost:4200/
